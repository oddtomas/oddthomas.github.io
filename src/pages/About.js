          Hi I'm Thomas, a web developer with a passion for clean, creative, and
          efficient code. I'm currently pursuing my Masters degree in Computer
          Science and transitioning from the medical field in the Army where
          problem solving was my day to day job so I felt like the transition to
          programming was very natural. In a way I'm still just solving problems
          for people, going from physical and mental support to a broader scale
          of support through coding and creating. Like medicine, coding is never
          ending journey of change and learning.
